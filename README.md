# USB-Secured Password Manager

A terminal-based password manager that locks your credentials inside an encrypted vault.  
Security comes from two layers:  
1. **LUKS-encrypted USB** that holds the secret key.  
2. **Fernet-encrypted vault** that stores your passwords.

---

## Security Features
- LUKS full-disk encryption on USB  
- USB unlock password  
- Fernet encryption of vault file  
- Unique Fernet key stored only on USB  
- Vault file permission hardened to `600`  
- Argon2 password hashing support / Soon  
- Aliases (`usbon` / `usboff`) for secure mount/unmount  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- System tools: `cryptsetup`, `iptables`, `iproute2`, `xclip`, `systemd`, `sudo`  
- Python packages: `cryptography`, `pyperclip`, `argon2-cffi`

    The installer will:

    Install required dependencies

    Set up an encrypted USB

    Generate and store a Fernet key on the USB

    Configure aliases for mounting/unmounting

Usage after installation

Mount the secure USB:
```bash
usbon
```
Start the password manager:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
Unmount the USB when done:

How it Works

    Without the USB, the Fernet key is missing â†’ vault cannot be opened.

    Without the LUKS password, the USB cannot be unlocked.

    Only your Linux user can read the vault (chmod 600).

    Clipboard use avoids typing sensitive strings.
